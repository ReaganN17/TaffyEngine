Lookup how to spell inherits 
All Events

General
- Make clear difference in struct and class (I think i mixed them up a bit already oops)
- Add ButtonObject class

Controls
- Make it cleaner ig? (it's sorta annoying to add a trigger)
- Maybe allow it to be inheritted for keyboard? (steps away from broadness)

Triggers
- Add boolean/condition properties, expand from buttons

Does it really need to be namespaced? (consider structs with static methods)
- EngineBase
- Input
- Win32Render
- Win32Window

Does it need to have getInstance? (again consider structs with static methods)
- EventHandler
- ObjectHandler
- SpriteHandler

Win32Window and Win32Render
- Organize Variables

Object and ObjectHandler
- consider separting addObject from object constructor

Sprite
- add deconstructor and prevent sprite map value replacement
- actual load check (ie image.data == NULL) instead of abstract boolean

EventHandler and Event
- test checkRequirements and cancelRequirements (are they really necessary?)

RGBA
- (low priority) optimize calculations

Timer
- (low priority) add more potentially useful features (ie lap, pause, accumlation)
