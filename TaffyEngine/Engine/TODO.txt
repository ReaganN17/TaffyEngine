Rendering
- Optimize rendering that's better than current per-pixel rendering

Sprite
- add deconstructor and prevent sprite map value replacement
- actual load check (ie image.data == NULL) instead of abstract boolean

EventHandler and Event
- test checkRequirements and cancelRequirements (are they really necessary?)


General
- Add ButtonObject class
- (low priority) Consider changing from const char* to std::string

Controls
- (low priority) Make it cleaner ig? (it's sorta annoying to add a trigger)


Object and ObjectHandler
- (low priority) consider separting addObject from object constructor

RGBA
- (low priority) optimize calculations

Timer
- (low priority) add more potentially useful features (ie lap, pause, accumlation)
